Hi all! I hope you've all enjoyed a fun and relaxing summer break! We're
kicking off a bit early this year; our first meeting will be on Monday,
August 25th after school in Mr. Morrison's room in the second-floor science
wing. The meeting will start at about 2:45 PM.

If you are at all interested in technology, engineering, invention, or just
plain having fun, be sure to stop by! Don't forget to let anyone who may be
interested know, too!
