Once again, the Parkway South Robotics Team had the opportunity to display
their robots to younger students interested in science pathways. On March
25, Oak Brook invited the team to display the robots at their Science Night.
Oak Brook's Science Night provided the robotics team with the gymnasium to
display how the robots function and what the club is all about. This
experience was unique, for students of all age groups were able to interact
with the Parkway South Robotics Team and walk around with the robots as they
functioned. The display attracted large crowds of both elementary students
and parents, and the team had a great time integrating everybody into the
world of robotics.
