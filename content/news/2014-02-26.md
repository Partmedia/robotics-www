The Parkway South Robotics Team plays a key role in encouraging the younger
students participating in the FIRST Lego League to continue with their careers
in robotics. On Tuesday, February 25, the team visited Wren Hollow for the
elementary school's science night. The students demonstrated the robots that
they will be bringing to compete at the state competition. The FLL members
were able to talk one-on-one with the Parkway South Team about how the robots
function and what robotics will be like at the high school level. FLL students
loved getting close to the robots, and the high school students enjoyed seeing
what the next generation of Parkway South Robotics will be like.
