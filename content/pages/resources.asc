Team meetings are generally held every Monday after school in the robotics room near the Tech Ed. department. Each team may meet more or less frequently; ask the team captain to be sure.

Git Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our Git repositories are currently hosted on http://qgit.dyndns.org/[Quasar Git Repositories]. Shell access to Quasar is required for write access.

Subversion Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During the summer following the 2013 FRC season, the decision was made to switch to Git, a fast, distributed version control system. The Subversion repository from the 2012-2013 competition season has been converted to two read-only Git repositories.

The primary motive for switching to Git was the need for a distributed VCS. During the FRC Regional Competition, several significant code changes were required. Because WiFi access was not available in the pit area, developers were unable to make use of the remote SVN repository.
