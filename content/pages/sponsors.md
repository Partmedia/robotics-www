Title: Sponsors

We would like to thank all of our sponsors for their support of our Robotics Club. The Parkway South Robotics Club is completly funded by our sponsers; we get no money from our school and we do not collect money from our members. We would also like to thank our very generous anonymous donor for all of his/her support.

If you would like to help us out and donate you can contact us at <tmorrison@pkwy.k12.mo.us>.
