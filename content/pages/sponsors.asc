Sponsors
========

We would like to thank all of our sponsors for their support of our Robotics Club. The Parkway South Robotics Club is completly funded by our sponsers; we get no money from our school and we do not collect money from our members. We would also like to thank our very generous anonymous donor for all of his/her support. If you are curious about who are sponsors are they are listed on the right side of the webpage, and if you want to learn more about them you can click their logo to go to their website.

If you would like to help us out and donate you can contact us at tmorrison@pkwy.k12.mo.us
