Parkway South participates in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) and the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). In addition, we sponsor several FLL teams at local elementary schools.

FTC
---
According to the FIRST website, "FTC is designed for those who want to compete head-to-head, using a sports model. Teams of up to 10 students are responsible for designing, building, and programming their robots to compete in an alliance format against other teams. The robot kit is reusable from year-to-year and is programmed using a variety of languages. Teams, including coaches, mentors and volunteers, are required to develop strategy and build robots based on sound engineering principles. Awards are given for the competition as for well as for community outreach, design, and other real-world accomplishments."

In the fall, Parkway South Robotics divided up into three teams; the red team 406, the white team 407, and the blue team 408, to play the FTC game. Each team had a different design to play this years game, Bowled Over. Even though each team is self sufficient, students helped other teams when their expertise was needed.

FRC
---
FIRST describes the FRC competition as "The varsity sport for the mind," FRC combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, teams of 25 students or more are challenged to raise funds, design a team brand, hone teamwork skills, and build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors.  It's as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.

Parkway South Robotics divides into specialty teams for this competition. The teams are: drive train, electrical, pneumatics, programming, animation, field builders, and communication. Each team plays a vital role in building a working robot and keeping the team functional.

We have also entered the Autodesk 3D animation contest since our rookie year in 2003 and consistently placed highly. Please check back soon for the animations and a robot designs once the game has been released.
