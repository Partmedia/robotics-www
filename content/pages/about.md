The Parkway South High Robotics team is comprised of students of all ages and backgrounds. We have some of the brightest and most dedicated students at Parkway South High. Robotics members also excel in other activities such as sports, art, music, academics, and performance. Students can take a break from those activities to fully submerge themselves in designing, building, and promoting robots for both the FRC and FTC competitions. This is a big time commitment but it is interesting, engaging, and always fun!

We have so many students participating in this program that we actually field three FTC teams (406, 407, and 408) to take on the challenges. The teams usually excel at the competition. For the past two years we have placed second at the regional competition and this year we also placed first. We have also done exceptionally well at the FRC regional, placing highly in the final rounds. Another fact that sets us apart from other teams is that we are completely sponsor-funded. Our school district does not fund us and we do not collect dues to be apart of the team and we also have bus transportation to and from competitions.
