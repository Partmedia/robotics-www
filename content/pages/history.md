Title: History

Parkway South Robotics has been participating in the FIRST programs since 2002. Every year we work our hardest to perform at competition and regularly place highly in competition. Below is a description of each year's challenges as well as our accomplishments that year.

## Rookie Year: 2002-2003 Stack Attack
The game for the 2003 season required robots to collect and stack plastic storage containers on their side of the playing field. The location of the robots and containers and the height of the stacks at the end of the match determined each team's score for the round.

- Midwest Regional Champion - Autodesk 3-D Animation Award
- Canadian Regional Champion - Autodesk 3-D Animation Award
- National Champions - Autodesk 3-D Animation Award NASA Robotic Rookie Team Grant ($8,000)

## 2003-2004 Raising the Bar
The game for the 2004 season required robots to collect and pass 13" balls to the human player to then shoot them into fixed and moveable goals. There were three 30" balls on the playing field that could be placed on top of any goal by a robot, which doubled the point value in the goal. Additionally, robots attempted to "hang" from a 10' bar.

- Alliance Finals - FIRST Midwest Regional Competition
- NASA Robotic Team Invitational Grant ($6,000)

## 2004-2005 Triple Play
The game for the 2005 season was played on a 27' wide by 52' long playing field with 9 goals configured in 3 x 3 matrix, similar to tic-tac-toe. The robots attempted to place the red and blue game tetras in or on one or more of the nine goals to score points and "claim ownership" of the goals.

- Finished 12th out of 52 teams from 14 Midwestern states
- Alliance Finals - FIRST Midwest Regional Competition
- Featured on PBS programs about Robotics and St. Louis

## 2005-2006 Aim High
In the 2006 game, students' robots were designed to launch balls into goals while human players entered balls into play and scored points by throwing/pushing balls into corner goals. Extra points were scored by robots racing back to their end zones and climbing the ramp to the platform before the end of the 2 minute and 10 second match.

- Finished 10th out of 50 teams in Midwest from 16 states
- "Motorola Award" for creative, durable engineering
- Alliance Finals - FIRST Midwest Regional Competition
- Featured on PBS special about Robotics and St. Louis
- Choosen as a featured team in future publications about the history the FIRST organization and competition
- Sponsered two FIRST Lego Elementary school teams

## 2006-2007 Rack n' Roll
In the game for the 2006 season, two alliances of three teams each competed to arrange toroidal game pieces on a central arena element known as The Rack. of the nine goals to score points and "claim ownership" of the goals.

- Midwest Regional Champion - Autodesk 3-D Animation Award
- Creative Innovation Award
- Finished 14th out of 48 Midwest teams from 17 states
- Finished 4th out of 20 from 5 states in the FIRST Tech Challenge (formally VEX)
- Alliance Finals - FIRST Midwest Regional Competition
- Sponsered two FIRST Lego Elementary school teams, one of which advanced to Nationals

## 2007-2008 Overdrive
In the 2008 game, students' robots were designed to race around a track knocking down 40" inflated Trackballs and moving them around the track, passing them either over or under a 6'6'; overpass. Extra points were scored by robots positioning the Trackballs back on the overpass before the end of the 2 minute and 15 second match.

- Three team grants to compete in FIRST Tech Challenge
- Teams finished 2nd, 6th, and 7th, in the finals alliances out of 30 teams from 6 states in the FIRST Tech Challenge
- Winner of a seed award (kit of parts) at Tech Challenge to be given to new school to invite to the 2008 competition
- Finished 10th out of 47 teams from 14 states
- Alliance Finals - FIRST Midwest Regional Competition

## 2008-2009 Lunacy
Lunacy was a game played on a field known as the crater. Two alliances, one red and one blue, composed of three FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams each, competed in each match. The object of the game was to attain a higher score than your opponent by placing the game pieces in the trailers hitched to the opposing alliance's robots.

- Three team grants to compete in FIRST Tech Challenge
- Three teams in the alliance finals in FIRST Tech Challenge
- Two teams finished 2nd in the finals of the FIRST Tech Challenge of 34 states
- Boeing Robotic Team Grant ($6,000)

## 2009-2010 Breakaway
Breakaway was a game played on a field where two alliances, one red and one blue, composed of three FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams each, competed in each match. The object of the game was to attain a higher score than your opponent by shooting balls into a goal, climbing on the alliance tower or platform, or by lifting an alliance robot off the playing surface.

## 2010-2011 Bowled Over
Bowled Over was played on a 12'x12' diamond shaped field. Two alliances - one "red" and one "blue" - composed of two teams each competed in matches consisting of a 30 second autonomous period followed by a two-minute driver controlled period. The object of the game was to score more points than your opponent's alliance by placing racquet balls into crates and then stacking the crates. Teams were challenged to complete tasks during autonomous and driver controlled periods and scorde special racquetballs and six pound bowling balls for additional points.

- Finished first and second in the regional competition

## 2011-2012 Rebound Rumble
In this game Alliances of 3 FRC teams are challenged to shoot baskets after crossing half court by a bridge or climbing over the 4 inch barrier. Each basket is worth a different amount of points. To throw in another twist, there is no autonomous period, instead players must direct their robot using preprogrammed commands through the X-Box Kinect system. At the end of the competition the robots must balance on the bridges for more points, on the middle bridge if 2 or more robots from opposing teams balance on it they are awarded extra points.

## 2012-2013 Ring It Up (FTC)
In this competition there are two alliances of three teams each and the goal is to outscore the other team by placing rings on pegs at three different heights (the higher it is the more points it's worth). In the autonomous period there is a infared beacon on one row of pegs; if a robot places a peg on that row then there is a onus given to that team. The pegs are set up in a 3x3 board when any combination of three that form a line recieve bonus points. In the endgame the robots will try to lift another robot on their alliance for extra points.
